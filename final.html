	The artistic inspiration came from watching detective programs and watching a lot of 90s batman cartoons growing up. I thought of ways to make this project my own, so when creating the characters design I decide to update his design for a more modern look. I choose to make an animated short, in the style of a movie trailer. My video was about Hank Powers potential final case of his career and some of the interactions that went along with this case. I used stop motion, then found a door knocking sound and a unique mystery theme on freesounds to be played underneath the voice over.
